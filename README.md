A Quick Note
=================

All of this is purely coded by me, Syntax. You can find the main code in `server.js`.

If you wish to use this, please at least credit me and my work somewhere.

What it Does
------------

A relatively simple Giveaway bot. Note that this is currently a legacy version (so there are no direct copies) but it still works fairly well.


Maintenance
-------------------
If you are looking to host this somewhere, be warned. You have to clean out the database file every once in a while. This is because legacy giftbot (this repo) was not using SQLite3 yet. This will cause rapid inflation of the file size but can be fixed with a cleaning every once in a while. (Search for: `"ended": true`)

If you have an questions, contact me: Syntax#9930
